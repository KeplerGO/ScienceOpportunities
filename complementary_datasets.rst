Complementary Datasets
======================

There are many freely available datasets that are complementary to Kepler data. Below is a list of datasets that you can use in your analysis of Kepler data. If there are any datasets missing, please do open a pull request!


Kepler
~~~~~~
- `Gaia <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/345>`_ : Gaia DR2 is an all sky survey with positions and brightness measurements. You can also use the cross match from Megan Bedell `here <http://gaia-kepler.fun>`_.
- `UKIRT <https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/related-surveys.html>`_ : The UKIRT data archive in Edinburgh provides positions and magnitudes for J band sources within the Kepler field. You can read more `here <https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/related-surveys.html>`_.
- UBV Photometric Survey: The Howell-Everett Kepler Field UBV Survey provided photometry of the Kepler field in the Johnson/Harris U, B, and V filters. The photometry was acquired with the NOAO Mosaic1.1 Camera on the WIYN 0.9m Telescope on Kitt Peak. Additional information about the survey and the link to download the data can be found here.
- Kepler INT Survey: The Kepler Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Survey provided photometry of the Kepler field in the Sloan ugri filters as well as in H-alpha. The photometry was obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma. Additional information about the survey can be found here.
- GALEX: In 2013 MAST staff produced a Kepler/GALEX cross match catalog and search interface. This catalog allows for comparisons between the optical and ultraviolet fluxes measured by Kepler and GALEX.



K2
~~
- `Gaia <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/345>`_ : Gaia DR2 is an all sky survey with positions and brightness measurements. You can also use the cross match from Megan Bedell `here <http://gaia-kepler.fun>`_.
- `UKIRT <https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/related-surveys.html>`_ : The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer and Project Offices ran two UKIRT programs, one to collect high spatial resolution images of the K2 fields in the K-band with the wide-field camera (WFCam) and one to acquire K-band spectra of K2 targets of interest with UIST. You can read more `here <https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/related-surveys.html>`_.
- `PanSTARRS <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sne/>`_ : Contemporaneous PanSTARRS photometry was taken during the (forward facing) campaigns 16 and 17. You can access the PanSTARRS data `here <https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sne/>`_.
